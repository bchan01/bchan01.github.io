   <p>Hello, my name is Brian Chan, I've been working in software engineering for over 15 years.  I started my career at the time when Java was at its peak and follow its entire evolution process.  So naturally, my main expertise is in Java based application development.  Over the last 3 years, I've managed to transform myself into a "Polygot Engineer".  In my current job, I spend my day coding in multiple languages incuding Java, Javascript (MEAN stack), Python and a bit of Scala.  I believe all engineers should develop an instinct to use the right tool for the right task.  I am also passionate about Big Data, specifically interested in exploring ways to apply Machine Learning in a Big Data environment to perform Predictive Analytics at scale. More about my work below:

   My philosophy in work and life in general could be summarized in one simple quote:
   
   </p><div align="center"><i>"Success is a journey, not a destination"</i></div></p>

   <p>It's important not to lose sight of the steps required to achieve success, focus on "doing the right thing" instead of taking shortcuts. At the same time, we should enjoy every step of the way, embrace changes, willing to try new ways of solving problems without the fear of failures. I am always open to learn and apply new technology to projects as long as it is <i>"the right tool for the righ task"</i>.  The right tools would always bring out the simplest yet elegant solution to the problem.
   </p>

   <p>Outside of work, I enjoy spending time with my family, trying to keep up with my super active 18-month old son.  Whatever time I have left (late nights and weekends), I spend on learning new technolgy and validate my learning by building projects.  My projects are hosted on <a href="https://www.github.com/bchan01" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.
