   <p>Hello, my name is Brian Chan, I've been working in software development for over 15 years.  I started my career at the time when Java was at its peak and followed its entire evolution process.  So naturally, Java has been my go-to language for a long time.  Over the last 4 years, I've managed to transform myself into a "Polyglot Engineer".  In my current job, I spend my day coding in multiple languages incuding Java, Javascript, Python.  
	   I am passionate about learning and applying new technology to solve problems. Currently, I am playing a key role in modernizing banking applications/systems with AWS Serverless Technologies.  More about my work below:

   My philosophy in work and life in general could be summarized in one simple quote:
   
   </p><div align="center"><i>"Success is a journey, not a destination"</i></div></p>

   <p>It's important not to lose sight of the steps required to achieve success, focus on "doing the right thing" instead of taking shortcuts. At the same time, we should enjoy every step of the way, embrace changes, willing to try new ways of solving problems without the fear of failures. I am passionate about learning and applying new technologies to projects as long as it is <i>"the right tool for the job"</i>.  The right tools would always bring out the simplest yet elegant solution to the problem.
   </p>

   <p>Outside of work, I enjoy spending time with my family, trying to keep up with my super active son Brandon.  Whatever time I have left (late nights and weekends), I spend on learning new technologies and validate my learning by building projects.  My projects are hosted on <a href="https://github.com/bchan01?tab=repositories" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.
