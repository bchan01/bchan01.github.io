        <h4>Data Masking using Python</b></h4></a>
    <p>This project illustrates how easy it is to mask sensitive data from a real production dataset to comply with user privacy law. It also include utilities for generating sizeable amount of data to be used for testing or analytics</p>

        <h4>Stock Portfolio Tracker Application (MEAN Stack)</h4></a>
    <p>Currently, I am developing a set of RESTful API to allow user to create stock portfolio and track its performance over time.  I am hoping to develop a user interface in the near future.</p>

    <h4>Exposing Legacy SOAP Web Services as REST API using Node</h4>
    <p>A simple framework developed in Node.JS to wrap SOAP Web service as RESTful Web Service without dealing with WDSL and schemas. All you need to do is to generate a SOAP envelope from tools like SOAP UI and use it as a template to make SOAP call via HTTP POST.  This framework will take care of XML to JSON and JSON to XML transformations.</p>
