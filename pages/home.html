        <h4>Stock Portfolio Tracker Application (MEAN Stack)</h4></a>

    <h4>Exposing Legacy SOAP Web Services as REST API using Node</h4></a>
    <p>A simple framework developed in Node to wrap SOAP Web services as RESTful services without dealing with WDSL and schemas. All that is required is a generated SOAP envelope from tools like SOAP UI. The SOAP envelope is used as a template to make SOAP call via HTTP POST. This framework takes care of the trivial XML to JSON and JSON to XML transformations.</p>
